\section{Components of Dialog Interfaces}
\label{apx:int-photos}
In this section, we provide short descriptions and screenshots of every component of the user and assistant dialog interfaces.

\subsection{User's Interface}

Figure~\ref{fig:entity-quiz} shows the interface that we use to sample the user's prior knowledge of entities related to the topic.
To derive a diverse sample, we use Wikipedia page views as a proxy for how well known the entity is.
All experiments use the English Wikipedia dump generated on July 23, 2019.
We divide entity mentions into ten buckets based on the frequency of page views, and round-robin sample fifteen entities from those buckets.
The interface is shown before the user starts chatting with the assistant.
\begin{figure}[ht]

    \nicebox{
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{2020_emnlp_curiosity/figures/entity-quiz.pdf}
    }
    \caption{
        In this example, the user is assigned to learn about \topic{Lesotho}, specifically its \aspect{culture} and \aspect{history}.
        In addition to their training with guidelines and videos, we repeat the instructions here.
        The related entities span relatively common ones like the \entity{United States} or \entity{Africa} to less known ones such as \entity{Basutoland}.
    }
    \label{fig:entity-quiz}
\end{figure}

We elicit how ``interesting'' a user finds each of the assistant's messages through the like button in Figure~\ref{fig:like-button}.
Only users can ``like'' a message; the assistant cannot ``like'' user messages.
Users are instructed to ``like'' messages if they are ``interesting, informative and/or entertaining'' and ``relevant to their topic and/or aspects.''
They are specifically instructed not to ``like'' messages that are devoid of factual content, only express feelings, or only contain greetings or farewells.

        \begin{minipage}{.60\textwidth}
            \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{2020_emnlp_curiosity/figures/like-button}
        \end{minipage}
    }
    \caption{
        The user expresses the ``interestingness'' of the assistant's messages through a ``like'' button (right of message).
        The instructions are shown prominently in the full interface and repeated in training material.
    }
    \label{fig:like-button}
\end{figure*}

\paragraph{Switching Aspect}
Users are randomly assigned two aspects for each dialog and told to spend time discussing each.
The guidelines instruct them to spend at least two turns per topic, but we do not specify any further time requirements.
When the user changes aspects, we instruct them to click a button (Figure~\ref{fig:switch-aspect}) to indicate when and which aspect they are switching to.
Additionally, this event triggers a reset in the context we use to rank the assistant's facts.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \nicebox{\includegraphics[width=.98\linewidth]{2020_emnlp_curiosity/figures/switch-aspect}}
    \caption{
        The user is assigned two aspects about their topic.
        After they are satisfied with what they have learned about the first aspect, they click a button and switch to the next aspect.
        While the button click is not communicated to the assistant (the user must send a corresponding message), it resets the fact contextualizer; we observe that without this, too many facts were related to the previous aspect.
    }
    \label{fig:switch-aspect}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Assistant Interface}

By design, we intend for most workers to not be familiar in depth with most of the geographic topics.
Thus, the most important responsibility of the assistant interface is to provide enough information---without overwhelming them---to be engaging conversational partners.
The first interface shown is a short description of the topic from either Simple Wikipedia or the English Wikipedia.
This component helps the assistant reach a general understanding of the topic so that they can choose better facts.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \nicebox{\includegraphics[width=.98\linewidth]{2020_emnlp_curiosity/figures/summary}}
    \caption{
        A short topic description is always visible to the assistant.
        The goal is to ensure the assistant always has a general understanding of the dialog topic.
    }
    \label{fig:summary}
\end{figure}

The most important component of the assistant interface is their list of available facts.
These facts have high textual similarity with the most recent three turns and are broken into three categories: facts related to entities the user knows about (rooted facts), facts related to an aspect (aspect facts), and facts from anywhere on the page (general facts).
Feedback from pilot collections showed that six facts was too few which caused a lack of relevant facts, but twelve facts overwhelmed annotators.
Thus, we use nine facts so that we can also balance equally across each type of fact.
When composing their reply, the assistant can use any number of facts as in Figure~\ref{fig:grounded-msg}.
To discourage verbatim copying, we disable the paste feature in javascript.
We also drop repeatedly unused facts.

\begin{figure*}[ht]

    \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}

        \nicebox{
            \includegraphics[width=.98\linewidth]{2020_emnlp_curiosity/figures/grounded-message}
        }
    \end{minipage}

    \caption{
        The assistant could incorporate any number of facts into their reply to the user.
        Their goal was to answer the user's immediate questions, and anticipate what information they would be most interested in.
    }
    \label{fig:grounded-msg}
\end{figure*}

\section{Dialog Act Annotation}
\label{apx:acts}
To annotate dialog acts, we create a separate annotation interface (Figure~\ref{fig:da-iface}).
The interface shows one dialog at a time, and the same annotator annotates all the utterances.
In addition to the utterances, the interface shows the topic, aspects, and sender of each message.
Lastly, we incorporate a ``Report Dialog'' feature to help identify and remove inappropriate dialogs.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{2020_emnlp_curiosity/figures/da-interface}
    \caption{
        To annotate dialog acts, we develop an interface that showed each utterance on a separate line.
        Annotators assign zero or more dialog acts to each utterance using grouped dropdowns.
    }
    \label{fig:da-iface}
\end{figure*}


\section{Sample Dialogs}
\label{apx:samples}
Tables~\ref{tab:dialog_example1} and~\ref{tab:dialog_example2} show \rover{} dialogs and highlight the dataset's features.
Typos and grammatical errors made by annotators are left unaltered.

\section{Paraphrase Analysis and Samples}
\label{apx:para}
In Section~\ref{sec:para-analysis}, we describe the results of a manual analysis on two hundred and fifty assistant paraphrases.
Annotations were completed by the authors and shown in Table~\ref{tab:para}.
We break messages into four categories: paraphrases, copies, errors, and unrelated.
Paraphrases include messages that incorporate the selected fact and possibly additional information.
Copies include verbatim copying, cherry-picked phrases, and trivial contextualizations like replacing an entity with a pronoun.
Table~\ref{tab:par-ex} shows ten randomly selected paraphrases from the two hundred and fifty manual annotations.

    \caption{
        We analyze the paraphrases annotators use through manual categorization.
        The ``Copy'' category includes cherry-picked verbatim phrases, verbatim copies, and contextualized copies (e.g., changing a named entity to ``it'').
        The majority of paraphrases are correct and only incorporate the provided fact, but a few weave in other information.
        $7.2\%$ of paraphrases are either unrelated to the selected facts or paraphrase the fact incorrectly.
        Overall, $51.2\%$ of messages have valid paraphrases.

\section{Like Prediction Comparison}
\label{apx:like-compare}
Like prediction is the one task where \charm{} was not the best model.
To better understand the differences between the \charm{} and \bert{} model, we randomly sample thirty dialogs in the test set and find assistant messages where the model predictions disagree.
Of the 202 assistant messages in the thirty dialogs, the \bert{} like prediction is correct 174 times ($86.1\%$) and \charm{} 170 times ($84.2\%$).
The models disagree on eight predictions ($3.96\%$); \bert{} is correct on six of these and \charm{} on the other two.
Table~\ref{tab:like-compare} shows the messages, predictions, and labels.
Although we might guess at why the predictions differ (e.g., perhaps something in the Florida dialog confused \bert{}), without further analysis we cannot establish causality.

\section{Model Training, Implementation, and Computation}
\label{apx:method:train}

We implement all models with PyTorch~\citep{paszke2017automatic} and \allennlp{}~\citep{Gardner2018AllenNLPAD}.
The learning rates for models is set using the built-in learning rate finder in \allennlp{}.
Model losses were optimized with Adam~\citep{Kingma2014AdamAM}; the \bert{} model uses a learning rate of $.0001$ and \charm{} a learning rate of $.001$ with otherwise default parameters.
We train for a maximum of forty epochs and early stop based on the sum of validation losses.
The \charm{} model uses batch size $64$ and the \bert{} model batch size $4$.
Our best model (\charm{}), has $26,970,475$ parameters, takes two hours and eighteen minutes to train, and early stops on epoch fifteen.
In our models, text encoders for utterances and facts share parameters.

Models were developed on a single machine with eighty Intel $2.0$GHz \abr{cpu}s, $256$\abr{gb} \abr{ram}, and eight Tesla V100 graphics cards.
Each model was trained and evaluated on a single graphics cards with hyper-parameter sweeps parallelized across the eight cards.

\allennlp{} configuration files and software dependencies (including version) are included in our code at \href{https://github.com/facebookresearch/curiosity}{github.com/facebookresearch/curiosity}.
